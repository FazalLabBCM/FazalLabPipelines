# Introduction to Using the Command Line

Welcome! This page will give you a quick introduction to using the TACO cluster. When you 
sign in to the TACO cluster, everything is controlled by the command line, which is where 
you type commands for the computer to execute. Here are a few simple commands.


## Sign in to the TACO cluster
Type this command, replacing `myuserid` with your user ID:
```
ssh myuserid@taco.grid.bcm.edu
```
Then press "Enter".

When prompted, type your password and press "Enter".

Now you're in!

You may be wondering, "Now I'm in? In where? Where am I on the TACO cluster?" That's a great 
question! Here's a map:



pwd
cd
ls


## Create, copy, and rename

mv
