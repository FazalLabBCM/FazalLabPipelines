# TrimMapCount
The [TrimMapCount](https://fazallabbcm.github.io/TrimMapCount) pipeline will map your RNA 
sequences to a reference genome and count how many reads map to each gene. This process produces 
useful data files from your raw data.


## Setup

On the TACO cluster, the Fazal lab has folders named `rawdata`, `data`, and `projects`. The 
`rawdata` folder is for your raw data files, the `data` folder is for your processed data files, 
and the `projects` folder is for all of your tables, figures, and log files (log files keep track 
of the progress of your running projects).

To begin, you should create a `rawdata` folder, `data` folder, and `project` folder all with the 
same name. For example, your file structure should look like this:
